## 👋 Hi, I’m Ana

I’m a Data Science sophomore at Purdue University, currently pursuing the addition of an Industrial Engineering degree to my plan of study.

I work as a Data Analytics Assistant in Purdue’s External Data Analytics Department, where I:

Build and maintain automated data collection pipelines

- Validate, clean, and analyze large, messy datasets

- Develop internal analytics tools to reduce manual effort and improve reliability and accuracy


I’ve also recently joined the Purdue undergraduate rocket propulsion lab ([PURPL](https://purpl.space/)), where I focus on:

- Designing data transfer systems between test-bed sensors and control systems

- Reducing latency (lagginess) and minimizing data corruption in experimental setups

- The best advice I ever got is from my mom: that success is like a bird's flight- not a permanent state, but composed of constant adjusment

- One habit I'd like to let go of is buying too many new sauces and not finishing them
